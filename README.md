Optimizing Horiseon's Marketing Page
Changes made to increase accessibility:
I updated the title tab thing from saying website to saying Horiseon.
I added a nav semantic element around the navigation links to make the site more readable. I updated the CSS sheet to match.
I consulted with the Xpert Learning Assistance on how to make the site more mobile friendly. I added the @media screen and the different CSS commands for margins and floating to make sure the navigation bar can be stacked if needed on smaller screens. I made margin zero so that the navigation bar can fill up the space of a smaller screen. 
I referenced class materials on flex boxes for how to make the website responsive to different screen sizes. px sizes matched to look good. I showed Instructor Andrew Bautista my code and he informed me that this challenge does not need changing the responsiveness, but nevertheless, he helped me fix it because I could not get it to work. He showed me where to put the display and flex directions in the code. I just thought that we were to apply what we learned in class to these assignemtns. I did not realize, when I wrote that code, that that was considered post-challenge information. 
I added the div id to the search engine optimization link to make it work. The other links had it, but this one did not, and therefore the link would not work. Now it does. 
I added alternative text to the images.
